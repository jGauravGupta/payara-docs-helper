  - The Java file uses `contextInfoEnabled` (with camel case) while the AsciiDoc uses `--contextinfoenabled` (with underscores). The AsciiDoc should match the Java naming convention for consistency.
  - The Java file uses `threadPriority` (camel case), while the AsciiDoc uses `--threadpriority` (lowercase with underscores). Again, the naming should be consistent.
  - The Java file uses `jndi_name` (lowercase with underscores) as a primary parameter, while the AsciiDoc refers to it as `jndi_name` but in the command invocation it is used as a positional argument, which could lead to confusion.

- **Missing Parameters**:
  - The AsciiDoc does not mention the `--property` parameter's separator, which is specified in the Java file as `:`. This detail is important for users to know how to format multiple properties.

### 2. New Features or Functionality in Java File
- The Java implementation has a `defaultValue` for many parameters (e.g., `enabled`, `contextinfoenabled`, `threadpriority`, etc.), which indicates default behavior that is not documented in the AsciiDoc. 
- The AsciiDoc does not mention the optional nature of the `target` parameter, nor does it specify that it defaults to `SystemPropertyConstants.DAS_SERVER_NAME`.

### 3. Suggested Updates to AsciiDoc
- Update the parameter descriptions in the AsciiDoc to reflect camel case naming for `--enabled`, `--contextinfoenabled`, `--threadpriority`, and potentially rename `--property` to clarify the separator `:` for multiple values.
- Add the default values for the parameters in the options section (e.g., `--enabled` defaults to `true`, `--contextinfoenabled` defaults to `true`, etc.).
- Include information on the `target` parameter and clarify its default value.

### 4. Discrepancies Between Documentation and Java Implementation
- The AsciiDoc states that `--property` is for "Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the resource." However, it does not mention the use of a separator (`:`) for multiple properties.
- The Java implementation uses `contextinfoenabled` as an alias for `--contextinfoenabled`, but this alias is not documented in the AsciiDoc.
- The AsciiDoc suggests that the command is supported in "remote mode only," while the Java file allows the command to be executed in various contexts (DAS, DOMAIN, CLUSTER, etc.), which is not clearly articulated in the documentation. 

These discrepancies and missing details could lead to confusion for users attempting to utilize the command effectively.

 =========================================

- **Missing Parameters**: 
  - The Java file includes several options for the `asadmin` command (e.g., `--terse`, `--echo`, `--interactive`, `--host`, `--port`, `--secure`, `--user`, and `--passwordfile`) that are not documented in the AsciiDoc.

### 2. New Features or Functionality in the Java File
- **Preauthorization Check**: The Java file implements a preauthorization check using the `preAuthorization` method to verify if the password alias exists before deletion.
- **Action Report**: The Java implementation uses an `ActionReport` to provide feedback on the command execution, including success and failure messages, which is not mentioned in the AsciiDoc.
- **Rest Endpoint Annotation**: The Java file includes annotations for REST endpoint configuration, indicating that the command can be executed via REST API, which is not documented in the AsciiDoc.

### 3. Suggested Updates to the AsciiDoc
- **Parameter Naming**: Update the `aliasname` to `aliasName` in the AsciiDoc to maintain consistency with the Java implementation.
- **Add Missing Options**: Include the following options in the AsciiDoc under the `Options` section:
  - `--terse`
  - `--echo`
  - `--interactive`
  - `--host`
  - `--port`
  - `--secure` or `-s`
  - `--user`
  - `--passwordfile`
- **Rest Endpoint Information**: Document that `delete-password-alias` can be accessed as a REST endpoint.

### 4. Discrepancies between Documentation and Java Implementation
- **Command Usage**: The AsciiDoc does not mention additional command-line options that are available in the Java file, which may lead users to believe the command only requires the `aliasname`.
- **Execution Result**: The documentation states that the command executes successfully; however, the Java code includes a detailed failure message and success message that are not reflected in the AsciiDoc, which could mislead users regarding the command's output.

 ========================================= 

## delete-profiler
1. **Discrepancies in Parameters:**
   - The AsciiDoc documentation mentions a `--target` option, but it does not specify the default value, which is `server` in the documentation. The Java file indicates that the default is `SystemPropertyConstants.DEFAULT_SERVER_INSTANCE_NAME`, which may not always equate to `server`. 
   - The AsciiDoc does not mention `@Param(name="target", optional=true, defaultValue=...)` used in the Java file, which specifies that the `target` parameter is optional and has a default value.

2. **New Features or Functionality in Java:**
   - The Java implementation includes annotations such as `@Service`, `@PerLookup`, `@I18n`, and `@RestEndpoint`, which are not documented in the AsciiDoc.

   - Mention the concept of preauthorization as it relates to the `delete-profiler` command to enhance the documentation's completeness.

4. **Discrepancies Between Documentation and Java Implementation:**
   - The AsciiDoc states that only one profiler can exist at a time, but it does not clarify how the command behaves when there is no existing profiler, which the Java code handles specifically.
   - The documentation indicates that the server must be restarted for changes to take effect, which is not explicitly confirmed or denied in the Java code; it could be interpreted that changes are applied immediately.
   - The AsciiDoc specifies the command is supported in remote mode only, while the Java implementation implies it may operate in both DAS (Domain Administration Server) and instance modes, which is not clearly reflected in the documentation.

 ========================================= 

## delete-protocol-filter
### 1. Discrepancies in Parameters
- **Naming Convention**: 
  - AsciiDoc uses `--protocol protocol-name`, while the Java implementation uses `@Param(name = "protocol", optional = false) String protocolName;`. The AsciiDoc should use `--protocol-name` to match the Java parameter name.
  
- **Missing Parameters**:
  - The AsciiDoc does not mention the `--target` parameter as `defaultValue`, which is set to `SystemPropertyConstants.DEFAULT_SERVER_INSTANCE_NAME` in the Java code. This should be documented.
  - The AsciiDoc documentation refers to the operand as `protocol-filter-name`, but it does not specify that this is the primary parameter with `@Param(name = "name", primary = true)` in the Java file.

### 3. Suggested Updates to AsciiDoc
- Update the `--protocol` option to `--protocol-name` for consistency with the Java parameter.
- Add a note in the options section about the `--target` parameter having a default value of `SystemPropertyConstants.DEFAULT_SERVER_INSTANCE_NAME`.
- Clarify the operand section to indicate that `protocol-filter-name` is the primary operand for deletion.

### 4. Discrepancies Between Documentation and Java Implementation
- The AsciiDoc states that the command deletes the protocol filter in remote mode only, but the Java implementation�s logic implies it can operate on different targets (DAS, instance, cluster, etc.), which should be noted.
- The AsciiDoc does not reflect that the `--target` parameter is optional, whereas the Java implementation does define it as such. 
- The exit status in the AsciiDoc is too simplistic and does not account for all potential failure conditions indicated in the Java implementation.

This concise comparison highlights inconsistencies, missing information, and necessary updates for software documentation consistency between the AsciiDoc and the Java implementation.

 =========================================

- The Java implementation retrieves and displays additional properties related to the monitoring service, such as `monitoringEnabled`, `amxEnabled`, `mbeanEnabled`, and `dtraceEnabled`, which are not explicitly covered in the AsciiDoc.
- The use of `RestEndpoints` and the command's RESTful implementation is absent from the documentation.

### 3. Suggested Updates to the AsciiDoc
- **Parameter Documentation**: Update the `--target` option to include its default value: 
  ```
  `--target`:: 
  This option helps specify the target on which you are retrieving the monitoring service configuration. Valid values are: +
  `server`;; Applies to the default server instance. This is the default value (DAS_SERVER_NAME).
  `cluster_name`;; Applies to every server instance in the cluster.
  `instance_name`;; Applies to a specified server instance.
  ```
- **Additional Properties**: Add a section under `Description` to mention that the command retrieves various monitoring service properties and lists them:
  ```
  The command retrieves the following properties of the monitoring service:
  - Monitoring Enabled
  - AMX Enabled
  - MBeans Enabled
  - DTrace Enabled
  ```

### 4. Discrepancies Between Documentation and Java Implementation
- The AsciiDoc states that the command is used to "view the current configuration of the monitoring service," but it does not specify that the command also formats this information into a structured output using `ColumnFormatter`, which is a notable feature in the Java implementation.
- The AsciiDoc does not mention the command's integration with REST endpoints, while the Java implementation includes annotations for REST functionality, indicating it can be accessed via HTTP calls.

 ========================================= 

## get-notification-configuration

In summary, the AsciiDoc documentation requires updates to align with the Java implementation, particularly concerning parameter naming, additional features, and clarifications on functionality.

 ========================================= 

## install-node-ssh
### 1. Discrepancies in Parameters
- **Parameter Naming**:
  - In the AsciiDoc, the `sshuser` parameter is documented but appears as `user` in the Java file, which could lead to confusion.
  - The `sshport` parameter is present in both documents but is represented as an integer in Java without the default value explicitly stated in the AsciiDoc.
  - The `sshkeyfile` parameter is documented in both but lacks a clear description in the AsciiDoc about its optionality and default behavior.
  
- **Missing Parameters**:
  - The Java file includes a `sshpassword` parameter that doesn't appear in the AsciiDoc documentation, which may cause users to overlook its necessity.
  - The Java implementation uses an internal variable `promptPass` to control whether to prompt for a password, which is not mentioned in the AsciiDoc.

### 2. New Features or Functionality in Java
- **Password Handling**: The Java implementation introduces a mechanism to store SSH passwords in a map (`sshPasswords`), which allows for password reuse without prompting the user multiple times.
- **SSH Key Existence Check**: The Java code checks for an existing SSH key file in a default location if none is provided, which is not documented in the AsciiDoc.
- **Directory Creation**: The Java code includes logic to create the installation directory if it does not exist, which is not referenced in the AsciiDoc.

- The Java file implements a delegate pattern by forwarding execution to `HealthCheckServiceLister`, but this behavior is not mentioned in the AsciiDoc, which might mislead users regarding the command's implementation details.
- The exit statuses are documented in the AsciiDoc but are not mentioned in the Java implementation, which might create a gap in understanding the command behavior after execution.


 ========================================= 

## list-http-lb-configs
### 1. Discrepancies in Parameters
- **Naming Convention**: 
  - The Java implementation uses `list_target` as the parameter name, while the AsciiDoc refers to it as `target`. This inconsistency can lead to confusion.
  
### 2. New Features or Functionality in the Java File
- **Operand Functionality**: The Java code allows the `list_target` parameter to be optional and can accept multiple meanings (e.g., it can be a cluster, server instance, or Lb config name). This multi-faceted use is not reflected in the AsciiDoc.
- **Logging**: The Java implementation includes logging features (using `Logger`) to provide feedback on the execution status, which is absent in the AsciiDoc.
- **REST Endpoint**: The Java file defines a REST endpoint for the `list-http-lb-configs` command, which is not mentioned in the AsciiDoc.

- **Parameter Handling**: The AsciiDoc does not mention that `target` can refer to multiple types (cluster, server, or Lb config), leading to ambiguity in command usage.
- **Missing Error Handling Documentation**: While the Java code handles cases where no configurations exist and logs messages, the AsciiDoc does not mention how users will be informed of these scenarios.

 ========================================= 

## list-http-listeners
### Discrepancies in Parameters

1. **Parameter Naming**: 
   - The AsciiDoc mentions the operand `target`, while the Java file uses `String target;` with a `defaultValue` set to `SystemPropertyConstants.DAS_SERVER_NAME`, which is not explicitly mentioned in the AsciiDoc.

2. **Verbose Option**:
   - The AsciiDoc does not document the `verbose` parameter (`boolean verbose;`), which allows for a detailed output listing (enabled by the `--long` or `-l` flag).

### New Features or Functionality in the Java File

- The Java implementation includes a `verbose` option that controls the output format, allowing the user to see both the names and ports of the listeners, which is not mentioned in the AsciiDoc.
- The Java file uses a `Target` service to determine the configuration based on the specified target, which is not described in the AsciiDoc.

- **Naming Conventions**: 
  - In AsciiDoc, the option `--backupdir` is mentioned, while in the Java file, it appears as `backupdir` (without the `--` prefix).
  - In AsciiDoc, the option `--backupconfig` is mentioned, but the Java file uses the variable `backupConfig` (case sensitivity and naming convention).
  - The operand `domain-name` in AsciiDoc does not match the Java implementation's variable `domainName` (underscore vs camelCase).

- **Missing Parameters**: 
  - The `--description` option is marked as obsolete in the Java file but is still included in the AsciiDoc as a valid option. This discrepancy means it should either be removed from the AsciiDoc or clarified that it is obsolete.

### 2. New Features or Functionality in Java
- The Java file includes a `backupFilename` parameter with optional validation for file existence and readability, which is implied but not explicitly detailed in the AsciiDoc.

- The AsciiDoc documentation lacks any mention of default values for parameters, while the Java implementation specifies a default value for `api-version`.
- The AsciiDoc refers to the command as `set-hashicorp-config-source-configuration`, while the Java command is defined as `SetHashiCorpSecretsConfigSourceConfigurationCommand`�though this discrepancy is minor, it could be made more explicit in the documentation.

 ========================================= 

## set-hazelcast-configuration
### 1. Discrepancies in Parameters
- **Parameter Naming Conventions**:
  - In the AsciiDoc, `--hazelcastconfigurationfile` is used, while in the Java file it's `hazelcastConfigurationFile`. The AsciiDoc should follow camel case for consistency with the Java implementation.
  - The AsciiDoc mentions `--startport`, while the Java file uses `startPort`.
  - The AsciiDoc uses `--kubernetesServicename`, while the Java file uses `kubernetesServiceName` (should be camel case).
  - The AsciiDoc includes `--cachemanagerjndiname`, while the Java file uses `cacheManagerJndiName` (should be camel case).
  - The AsciiDoc includes `--cachingproviderjndiname`, while the Java file uses `cachingProviderJndiName` (should be camel case).
  - The AsciiDoc uses `--scheduledexecutorpoolsize`, while the Java file uses `scheduledExecutorPoolSize`.
  - The AsciiDoc uses `--scheduledexecutorqueuecapacity`, while the Java file uses `scheduledExecutorQueueCapacity`.
  - The AsciiDoc includes `--configSpecificDatagridStartport`, while the Java file uses `configSpecificDataGridStartPort` (should be camel case).

- **Missing Parameters**:
  - The AsciiDoc does not mention `--autoIncrementPort`, which is present in the Java file.
  - The AsciiDoc does not mention `--encryptdatagrid`, which is also present in the Java file.
  - The Java file includes `kubernetesNamespace`, but the AsciiDoc uses `--kubernetesNamespace` (should be consistent).

### 2. New Features or Functionality in Java Not Documented in AsciiDoc
- The Java implementation includes parameters for `autoIncrementPort` and `encryptDatagrid`, which are not documented in the AsciiDoc.
- The Java file has functionality for validating multicast addresses and port numbers, which is not mentioned in the AsciiDoc.
- The Java implementation supports dynamic updates to Hazelcast configurations, which is not explained in the AsciiDoc.

### 3. Suggested Updates to AsciiDoc
- Update parameter names to use camel case for consistency (e.g., `--hazelcastConfigurationFile` instead of `--hazelcastconfigurationfile`).
- Add documentation for `--autoIncrementPort` and `--encryptdatagrid` parameters.
- Provide details on input validation for parameters like `startPort` and `multicastPort`.
- Include descriptions for the dynamic configuration update feature.

### 4. Discrepancies Between Documentation and Java Implementation
- The AsciiDoc states that if no `target` is specified, the default is `server`, while the Java file defaults to `domain`.
- The AsciiDoc indicates that not specifying `--enabled` defaults to `true`, while the Java file allows for `null`, leading to a more complex default behavior.
- The AsciiDoc suggests that `--hazelcastconfigurationfile` defaults to `hazelcast-config.xml`, but the Java implementation allows for a custom file to be set with no default fallback if the provided file is incorrect. 

In summary, the AsciiDoc needs consistency in naming conventions and completeness regarding parameters and functionality present in the Java code.

 ========================================= 

## set-healthcheck-configuration
### 1. Discrepancies in Parameters
- **Naming Conventions**: 
  - The AsciiDoc uses `--enable-notifiers` and `--disable-notifiers`, while the Java file uses `enableNotifiers` and `disableNotifiers` (camelCase vs. kebab-case).
  - The AsciiDoc uses `--set-notifiers`, while the Java file uses `setNotifiers` (again, camelCase vs. kebab-case).
- **Missing Parameters**: 
  - The `--target` parameter in the AsciiDoc has a default value of `server`, while in the Java file, it defaults to `server-config`.
  - The AsciiDoc mentions `--historic-trace-store-timeout` without detailing the expected input format in the same way it is handled in the Java file.

### 2. New Features or Functionality in Java
- The Java file includes a `dynamic` parameter that allows configuration changes to be applied without a server restart, which is not explicitly documented in the AsciiDoc.
- The Java implementation includes detailed logic for handling the addition and removal of notifiers, including checking their validity against existing notifier names, which is not mentioned in the AsciiDoc.

### 3. Suggested Updates to the AsciiDoc
- **Parameter Consistency**: Change `--set-notifiers` to `--set-notifiers` and mention that this is an alias for `setNotifiers`.
- **Default Values**: Clarify the default value for `--target` as `server-config` instead of just `server`.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Add a note about the `--dynamic` parameter, detailing its functionality regarding live updates without server restart.
- **Notifier Handling**: Include a brief description of how the notifiers are validated against known notifiers when using `--enable-notifiers`, `--disable-notifiers`, and `--set-notifiers`.

### 4. Discrepancies Between Documentation and Implementation
- The AsciiDoc states that `--enabled` defaults to `false`, while Java does not specify a default value for this parameter.
- The AsciiDoc includes `--historic-trace-enabled` as defaulting to `false`, which is consistent; however, it lacks the context provided in Java about how this interacts with other parameters.
- The AsciiDoc suggests a comma-separated list for notifiers without mentioning the validation logic present in the Java file, which ensures that only recognized notifiers are processed.

In summary, while there are many similarities in functionality, the discrepancies in parameter naming conventions, missing details, and the absence of certain features in the documentation create inconsistencies that should be addressed to improve clarity and usability.

 ========================================= 

## set-healthcheck-service-configuration
### 1. Discrepancies in Parameters
- **Parameter Naming Conventions:**
  - In the AsciiDoc, `--enabled` is used, whereas in the Java file it's `enabled` (without the double dash).
  - `--hogging-threads-threshold` in AsciiDoc maps to `hogging-threads-threshold` in Java but is referred to as `threshold-percentage` in the Java file.
  - `--hogging-threads-retry-count` in AsciiDoc is `hogging-threads-retry-count` in the Java file, but it's referenced as `retry-count` in the Java file.
  - `--stuck-threads-threshold-unit` in AsciiDoc is `stuck-threads-threshold-unit`; in Java, it is `thresholdUnit` (camelCase).
  
- **Missing Parameters:**
  - `--stuck-threads-blacklist-patterns` is present in the Java file but not documented in the AsciiDoc.
  - There is no mention of the optional `--dynamic` parameter in the AsciiDoc.

### 2. New Features or Functionality in the Java File
- The Java implementation includes:
  - `stuck-threads-blacklist-patterns` parameter for configuring blacklisted patterns for stuck threads.
  - An integration with the MicroProfile Metrics Checker, which allows for adding and deleting metrics.
  - The ability to specify multiple metrics to add or delete using the `--add-metric` and `--delete-metric` parameters.

### 3. Suggested Updates to the AsciiDoc
- Add `--dynamic` parameter with description and default value.
- Include `--stuck-threads-blacklist-patterns` parameter in the options section with a suitable description.
- Update `--hogging-threads-threshold` description to indicate that it is referred to as `threshold-percentage` in the Java implementation for clarity.
- Ensure consistency in parameter names between AsciiDoc and Java file, for instance, align `threshold-percentage` with the AsciiDoc equivalent.

### 4. Discrepancies Between Documentation and Java Implementation
- The AsciiDoc states that `--enabled` defaults to `false`, which matches the Java code, but the Java file does not specify the default value in the documentation.
- AsciiDoc mentions `--time` defaults to `5`, while in Java, there is no explicit default value assignment in the parameter declaration.
- The AsciiDoc does not mention `checker-name` as optional in the context of the Java file.
- The AsciiDoc describes the `service` parameter as required but does not clearly indicate how its alias (`serviceName`) is handled in the Java implementation.

By addressing these discrepancies and suggestions, the documentation can be made more accurate and consistent with the actual implementation.

 ========================================= 

## set-jdbc-config-source-configuration
### 1. Discrepancies in Parameters
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - AsciiDoc uses `--jndiname`, `--tablename`, `--keycolumnname`, and `--valuecolumnname` (all lower case with hyphens).
  - Java file uses `jndiName`, `tableName`, `keyColumnName`, and `valueColumnName` (camelCase).
  
- **Missing Parameters:**
  - The AsciiDoc does not document the `target` parameter as optional with a default value, while the Java file specifies it as optional and defaults to `SystemPropertyConstants.DAS_SERVER_NAME`.

### 2. New Features or Functionality in Java
- The Java file includes:
  - Use of `@RestEndpoint` annotation indicating an HTTP POST operation to configure JDBC Config Source, which is not mentioned in the AsciiDoc.
  - The `@Param` annotation indicates the parameters are injected and managed, suggesting a structured approach to parameter handling that is absent in the documentation.

- The AsciiDoc lacks mention of the `target` parameter's optionality and its default value, which is present in the Java code.
- The AsciiDoc does not document how the configuration is applied using `ConfigSupport`, which is a key aspect of the implementation.

 ========================================= 

## set-jms-notifier-configuration
### Discrepancies in Parameters
1. **Parameter Naming Convention**:
   - AsciiDoc uses `--userName`, while the Java implementation uses `username`. The AsciiDoc should consistently use `--username` to match the Java parameter.
   
2. **Missing Parameters**:
   - The following parameters present in the Java file are missing from the AsciiDoc:
     - `--username` (noted in AsciiDoc as `--userName` but should be consistent)
     - `--password` (noted in AsciiDoc as `--password`, but no indication it is optional)
     - `--enabled` and `--dynamic` are documented in AsciiDoc but not explicitly mentioned as parameters in the Java file.

### New Features or Functionality in Java File
- The Java file includes a service annotation (`@Service`) for the command, which is not mentioned in the AsciiDoc.
- The `@Param` annotations specify that `username` and `password` are optional, which is not documented in the AsciiDoc.

### Suggested Updates to AsciiDoc
- Change `--userName` to `--username` in the options section to maintain consistency with the Java file.
- Clarify that `--username` and `--password` are optional parameters.
- Add a note about the `@Service` annotation indicating that the command is registered as a service.
- Ensure that all parameters in the Java file are represented in the AsciiDoc content.

### Discrepancies Between Documentation and Java Implementation
- The AsciiDoc states `--enabled` and `--dynamic` but does not clarify their default values in the Java file or mention how they interact with the configuration.
- The AsciiDoc lacks detail about the `applyValues` method, which is essential for understanding how parameters are applied to the configuration, while the Java implementation elaborates on this process.
- The AsciiDoc does not mention the use of the `BaseSetNotifierConfigurationCommand` class in the Java implementation, which could provide context on how the configuration is managed.

 ========================================= 

## set-jmx-monitoring-configuration
### 1. Discrepancies in Parameters
- **Parameter Naming Conventions**:
  - In the AsciiDoc, the parameter for enabling JMX monitoring is `--enabled`, while in the Java file it is represented as `@Param(name = "enabled")`. This is consistent.
  - The option `--logFrequency` in AsciiDoc is `logfrequency` in Java (lowercase), which is consistent because Java parameters are typically camelCase.
  - The option `--logFrequencyUnit` in AsciiDoc is `logfrequencyunit` in Java (lowercase). This is consistent with Java naming conventions.
  - The AsciiDoc uses `--addAttribute` while the Java implementation uses `@Param(name = "addattribute", alias = "addproperty")`. 
  - The AsciiDoc uses `--delAttribute` while the Java implementation uses `@Param(name = "delattribute", optional = true, multiple = true, alias = "delproperty")`. 
  - The AsciiDoc has `--set-notifiers`, `--enable-notifiers`, and `--disable-notifiers`, while in Java they are defined as `@Param(name = "setNotifiers", alias = "set-notifiers")`, `@Param(name = "enableNotifiers", alias = "enable-notifiers")`, and `@Param(name = "disableNotifiers", alias = "disable-notifiers")`. This indicates a discrepancy in naming conventions for the notifier parameters.

### 2. New Features or Functionality in the Java File
- The Java implementation includes a `dynamic` parameter with default value handling, which is not mentioned in the AsciiDoc.
- The capability to use `@Param` annotations with aliases (e.g., `addproperty`, `delproperty`) provides flexibility in parameter naming that is not documented in the AsciiDoc.
- The Java file includes a `@Deprecated` annotation for the `amx` parameter, which is not noted in the AsciiDoc.

### 3. Suggested Updates to the AsciiDoc
- **Add Missing Parameters**: Include information about `--dynamic` and its default value of `false`.
- **Parameter Aliases**: Document the aliases for `--addAttribute` and `--delAttribute` to clarify that they can also be invoked with `addproperty` and `delproperty`.
- **Notifiers Section**: Clarify the naming consistency for notifiers in the documentation to align with the Java implementation and mention that `enable-notifiers`, `disable-notifiers`, and `set-notifiers` are synonymous with their Java representations.

### 4. Discrepancies Between Documentation and Java Implementation
- The Java implementation allows multiple values for `--addAttribute` and `--delAttribute`, but this multiplicity is not clearly stated in the AsciiDoc.
- The `--target` option defaults to `server-config` in the Java file, while the AsciiDoc states that the valid values include `server`, `cluster_name`, and `instance_name`, without specifying a default.
- The AsciiDoc notes the default value for `--enabled` as `false`, but the Java implementation lacks clarity on default values for other parameters, particularly `--dynamic`.

In summary, while there are several alignments in naming conventions, the discrepancies in parameter handling, missing features in documentation, and the lack of clarity about default values require updates to ensure consistency between the AsciiDoc and the Java implementation.

 ========================================= 

## set-ldap-config-source-configuration
### 1. Discrepancies in Parameters
- **Naming Conventions**: 
  - The AsciiDoc uses `--bindDN` while the Java file uses `bindDN` (No `--` in Java).
  - The AsciiDoc uses `--startTLSEnabled`, while the Java file uses `startTLSEnabled` (No `--` in Java).
- **Missing Parameters**: 
  - The AsciiDoc does not document the `--searchScope` parameter's acceptable values properly compared to the Java file which specifies them as "subtree, onelevel, object".
  - The `--connectionTimeout` and `--readTimeout` in the AsciiDoc do not specify that they are optional and should be treated as such.

### 2. New Features or Functionality in the Java File
- The Java implementation includes validation checks that enforce the presence of required parameters based on the selected authentication type (i.e., it checks if `bindDN` and `bindDNPassword` are present for `simple` auth type and if `searchBase` and `searchFilter` are present for `none` auth type). This behavior is not documented in the AsciiDoc.
- The Java file allows for optional parameters (`bindDN`, `bindDNPassword`, `searchBase`, `searchFilter`, `searchScope`, `connectionTimeout`, and `readTimeout`), but the AsciiDoc does not clearly mark their optional status.

### 3. Suggested Updates to the AsciiDoc
- **Update Parameter Naming**: Remove the `--` from parameter names in the AsciiDoc to match Java conventions.
- **Add Acceptable Values**: Clearly specify the acceptable values for `--searchScope` in the AsciiDoc.
- **Clarify Optional Parameters**: Indicate that `--bindDN`, `--bindDNPassword`, `--searchBase`, `--searchFilter`, `--searchScope`, `--connectionTimeout`, and `--readTimeout` are optional in the AsciiDoc.

### 4. Discrepancies Between Documentation and Java Implementation
- The AsciiDoc states that `--authType` defaults to `none`, whereas the Java file has it defaulting to `AUTH_TYPE_NONE`, which may imply a different interpretation.
- The AsciiDoc does not mention that the `--enabled` parameter defaults to `false`, which is a critical detail missing in the documentation.
- The AsciiDoc should emphasize that the `--bindDN` and `--bindDNPassword` are mandatory only when `--authType=simple` is selected, which is a condition applied in the Java file but not documented in the AsciiDoc.

 ========================================= 

## set-log-attributes
### 1. Discrepancies in Parameters
- **Naming Conventions**: 
  - In the Java file, the parameter for logging attributes is named `name_value`, while in the AsciiDoc, it is referred to as `attribute-name=attribute-value`.
  
- **Missing Parameters**: 
  - The Java file includes an optional `validate` parameter with a default value of `true`, which is not documented in the AsciiDoc.
  - The AsciiDoc documentation does not mention the `primary` attribute of the `name_value` parameter.
  
### 2. New Features or Functionality in Java
- The Java implementation includes the ability to validate the attributes before setting them, which is not mentioned in the AsciiDoc.
- The Java file supports both DAS (Domain Administration Server) and instance targets through the `@ExecuteOn` and `@TargetType` annotations, which are not covered in the AsciiDoc.

### 3. Suggested Updates to AsciiDoc
- Add a section for `--validate` to the options, detailing its optional nature and default value.
- Clarify the parameter naming convention by using `name_value` for the logging attributes.
- Include information about the command being executable on both DAS and instance targets.
- Introduce a note on the validation of attributes, highlighting that invalid attributes will not be set.

- The AsciiDoc states that the `set-log-attributes` command is supported in remote mode only, while the Java implementation suggests it can be executed on both DAS and local instances.
- The exit statuses in the AsciiDoc (0 for success, 1 for error) do not cover the detailed conditions captured in the Java file, which includes specific messages for invalid attributes and targets.
- The AsciiDoc mentions that a server restart may be necessary, which is not discussed in the Java code, indicating a potential inconsistency in operational expectations.

 ========================================= 

## set-log-file-format
### 1. Discrepancies in Parameters
- **Parameter Naming**: The AsciiDoc mentions the `formatter` operand but refers to it as a valid value, whereas the Java file defines it as a parameter with a default value of `ODL`.
- **Missing Parameters**: 
  - The Java file has a `target` parameter with a default value of `SystemPropertyConstants.DAS_SERVER_NAME`, which is not explicitly mentioned in the AsciiDoc.
  - The Java implementation allows for a custom formatter (fully qualified class name), but this is not clearly articulated in the AsciiDoc.

### 2. New Features or Functionality in Java
- The Java file supports the concept of a default value for the `formatter` parameter (`ODL`), which is not mentioned in the AsciiDoc.
- The Java implementation can distinguish between different types of targets (DAS, Instance, Cluster) and applies logging properties accordingly. This level of detail about how target resolution works is absent in the AsciiDoc.

### 3. Suggested Updates to AsciiDoc
- **Default Value**: Include information about the default value for the `formatter` parameter being `ODL`.
- **Target Parameter**: Clearly define the `target` parameter along with its default value.
- **Clarification for Custom Formatter**: Emphasize that a custom formatter can be specified and that it should be the fully qualified class name. 

### 4. Discrepancies Between Documentation and Implementation
- The AsciiDoc does not mention that the `target` parameter can default to `SystemPropertyConstants.DAS_SERVER_NAME`, leading to potential confusion.
- The AsciiDoc states that the formatter can be set to ULF or ODL; however, it does not clarify that it can also accept a fully qualified class name as a custom formatter.
- The AsciiDoc implies that the command is supported only in remote mode, while the Java code indicates it can operate in multiple contexts (DAS, Instance, Cluster). 

This concise comparison highlights the main discrepancies and suggests focused updates for better alignment between the documentation and the implementation.

 ========================================= 

## set-log-levels
### 1. Discrepancies in Parameters
- **Parameter Naming**: 
  - AsciiDoc refers to the parameter as `logger-name=logger-level`, while the Java file uses `logger_name=logging_value`.
  - AsciiDoc uses `--target` for specifying the target, while the Java file defaults to `SystemPropertyConstants.DAS_SERVER_NAME` without explicitly mentioning `--target`.
  
- **Missing Parameters**: 
  - The AsciiDoc mentions `logger-name=logger-level` but does not specify that it can accept multiple logger definitions separated by colons. The Java file explicitly allows this format.

### 2. New Features or Functionality in the Java File
- **Dynamic Targeting**: The Java code allows specifying the target via the `target` parameter, which can be a server, cluster, or instance, but this flexibility is not clearly articulated in the AsciiDoc.
- **Support for Extended Log Levels**: The Java implementation includes additional log levels such as `ALL`, `OFF`, `EMERGENCY`, and `ALERT`, which are not documented in the AsciiDoc.
- **Microservice Environment Handling**: The Java code includes logic to read the logging configuration specifically in a microservice context, which is not mentioned in the AsciiDoc.

### 3. Suggested Updates to AsciiDoc

- **Clarify Target Parameter**: Include information about the default target value and clarify that it can accept `server`, `cluster`, or `instance`.
- **Log Levels**: Expand the documentation to include all valid log levels listed in the Java file, including `ALL`, `OFF`, `EMERGENCY`, and `ALERT`.
- **Multiple Loggers**: Clarify that multiple loggers can be specified in the format `logger_name=logging_value:logger_name=logging_value`.

### 4. Discrepancies Between Documentation and Implementation
- **Log Level Defaults**: The AsciiDoc states that the default setting is `INFO`, while the Java implementation does not explicitly mention a default level for unspecified loggers.
- **Dynamic Changes**: The AsciiDoc mentions that changes take effect dynamically, but it does not clarify that this applies to specific server instances or clusters, which is implied in the Java implementation.
- **Return Values**: The AsciiDoc lists exit status codes, but the Java file includes additional conditions surrounding the success or failure of setting log levels that are not reflected in the documentation.

In summary, the AsciiDoc needs to be updated to reflect the naming conventions, additional features, and more comprehensive details present in the Java implementation to ensure consistency and clarity.

 ========================================= 

## set-log-notifier-configuration

- **Help Parameter**: 
  - The AsciiDoc lists `--help`, but there is no mention of it in the Java implementation. It is unclear whether this parameter is intended to invoke help or if it is implemented.

- **Error Messaging**: 
  - The AsciiDoc does not cover the error messages generated in the Java implementation, which provides specific feedback when invalid module names are supplied or when the counts of modules and levels do not match.

- **Exit Status Codes**: 
  - While the exit status codes are documented in the AsciiDoc, the conditions under which they are set (such as specific error messages) are not aligned with the checks performed in the Java implementation.

 ========================================= 

## set-monitoring-service-configuration
### 1. Discrepancies in Parameters
- **Parameter Naming Conventions**:
  - AsciiDoc uses `--enabled`, `--mbeansenabled`, `--amxenabled`, and `--dtraceenabled`, while the Java implementation uses `monitoringEnabled`, `mbeanEnabled`, `amxEnabled`, and `dtraceEnabled`. The AsciiDoc should align with the Java parameter names for consistency.
  
- **Missing Parameters**:
  - The Java file has a parameter `monitoringEnabled` which is not explicitly mentioned in the AsciiDoc.

### 2. New Features or Functionality in the Java File
- The Java file includes an `@Deprecated` annotation for `amxEnabled`, indicating it is deprecated in favor of using the `set-amx-enabled` command, which is not mentioned in the AsciiDoc.
